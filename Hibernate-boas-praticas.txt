Do not use exotic association mappings:
Practical test cases for real many-to-many associations are rare. Most of the time you need additional information stored in the "link table". In this case,
it is much better to use two one-to-many associations to an intermediate link class. In fact, most associations are one-to-many and many-to-one.
For this reason, you should proceed cautiously when using any other association style.

Prefer bidirectional associations:
Unidirectional associations are more difficult to query. In a large application, almost all associations must be navigable in both directions in queries.
